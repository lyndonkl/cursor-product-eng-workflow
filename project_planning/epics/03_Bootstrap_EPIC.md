# EPIC: Project Bootstrap and Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
This EPIC focuses on setting up the project infrastructure, including the Next.js application, development environment, build processes, and all necessary dependencies. It establishes the foundation for development and deployment of the GDP Timeline Visualization project.

## Objectives
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure development environment and tools
- Establish project structure and conventions
- Set up build and deployment processes
- Configure testing infrastructure

## Dependencies
- Partial dependency on UI/UX EPIC (for styling setup)
- Partial dependency on Data EPIC (for data structure implementation)

## Key Deliverables

### Project Setup

#### Base Configuration
- Next.js 14 with App Router setup
- TypeScript configuration
- ESLint and Prettier setup
- Git configuration and .gitignore
- Environment variable setup
- VSCode configuration

#### Dependencies
- Core dependencies
  - React 18+
  - Next.js 14
  - TypeScript
  - D3.js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Shadcn UI
- Development dependencies
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Testing libraries
  - Build tools

#### Project Structure
- App router directory structure
- Components organization
- Data management structure
- Asset organization
- Type definitions
- API routes (if needed)

### Development Environment

#### Build Configuration
- Development build setup
- Production build optimization
- Static asset handling
- Bundle optimization
- Source maps configuration

#### Development Tools
- Hot reload configuration
- Debug configuration
- Development server setup
- Browser developer tools integration

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Setup
- Jest configuration
- React Testing Library setup
- E2E testing setup (if required)
- Test utilities and helpers
- Test data fixtures

### Documentation

#### Project Documentation
- README.md with setup instructions
- Contributing guidelines
- Code style guide
- Architecture documentation
- API documentation (if applicable)

#### Development Workflows

- Development process guidelines
- Code review process
- Deployment process

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: Initial Project Setup
- Create Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Set up directory structure
- Initialize Git repository

### Task 2: Development Environment
- Configure development server
- Set up hot reload
- Configure debugging tools
- Set up environment variables

### Task 3: Build Process
- Configure production build
- Set up asset optimization
- Configure bundle analysis
- Implement deployment scripts

### Task 4: Testing Setup
- Configure testing framework
- Set up test runners
- Create test utilities
- Set up CI/CD (if required)

## Success Criteria
- Functioning development environment
- Successful production builds
- Passing initial tests
- Complete documentation
- Optimized build process
- Working deployment pipeline

## Technical Considerations
- Next.js App Router best practices
- TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Bundle size optimization
- Development experience
- CI/CD requirements

## Risks and Mitigations
- Dependency conflicts
  - Mitigation: Careful version management and testing
- Build performance issues
  - Mitigation: Implement build optimization strategies
- Development environment inconsistencies
  - Mitigation: Documented setup process and containerization

## Timeline Estimate
- Initial Setup: 0.5 week
- Environment Configuration: 0.5 week
- Build Process Setup: 0.5 week
- Testing Infrastructure: 0.5 week
Total: ~2 weeks

## Additional Notes
- Consider Docker setup for consistent development environment
- Plan for future scaling and maintenance
- Consider monitoring and analytics setup
- Plan for accessibility testing infrastructure
