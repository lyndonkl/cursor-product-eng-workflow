# EPIC: Data Organization and Structure

## Overview
This EPIC focuses on collecting, organizing, and structuring all the historical GDP data, technological milestones, and supporting information required for the visualization. It includes data normalization, validation, and the creation of appropriate data structures for efficient rendering and interaction.

## Objectives
- Organize and normalize historical GDP data
- Structure technological milestone information
- Create data models for efficient visualization
- Define data validation rules
- Establish data update patterns for future projections

## Dependencies
- Partial dependency on UI/UX EPIC (needs visualization requirements)

## Key Deliverables

### Core Data Sets

#### GDP Data Structure
- Historical GDP values (1700-2020)
  - Year
  - GDP value (normalized to consistent currency)
  - Confidence level/range
  - Source attribution
- Future projections (2020-2050)
  - Projected GDP values
  - Confidence intervals
  - Methodology notes

#### Technological Milestones
- Major breakthroughs database
  - Year/time period
  - Event description
  - Impact assessment
  - Related GDP effects
  - Geographic location
  - Key figures/inventors

#### Regional/Country Data
- Country-specific GDP trends
- Industrial revolution impacts by region
- Technology adoption patterns
- Economic power shifts

### Data Models

#### Timeline Model
- Data structure for efficient timeline rendering
- Relationship mapping between events and GDP changes
- Temporal clustering for dense periods
- Scale normalization for visualization

#### Event Model
- Categorization system for technological breakthroughs
- Impact classification schema
- Connection mapping between related events
- Supporting content structure (images, quotes, references)

### Data Validation

#### Validation Rules
- GDP value range validation
- Date consistency checks
- Required field validation
- Cross-reference verification
- Source attribution requirements

#### Data Quality Checks
- Outlier detection
- Missing data handling
- Inconsistency identification
- Source reliability assessment

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Data Source Evaluation
- Review and assess primary data sources
  - Maddison Project
  - World Bank
  - IMF
  - PwC projections
- Document data normalization requirements
- Identify gaps and inconsistencies

### Task 2: Data Structure Design
- Design normalized data schema
- Define relationships between different data types
- Create efficient lookup patterns
- Document update/maintenance procedures

### Task 3: Validation Framework
- Develop validation rule set
- Create data quality metrics
- Define error handling procedures
- Establish data update protocols

## Success Criteria
- Complete, normalized historical GDP dataset
- Structured technological milestone database
- Documented data relationships and dependencies
- Implemented validation rules
- Efficient data access patterns
- Clear update/maintenance procedures

## Technical Considerations
- Data format optimization for D3.js
- Memory usage optimization
- Data loading performance
- Update pattern efficiency
- Browser storage considerations

## Risks and Mitigations
- Data inconsistencies across sources
  - Mitigation: Clear normalization rules and source attribution
- Large dataset performance impact
  - Mitigation: Implement data chunking and lazy loading
- Future projection accuracy
  - Mitigation: Clear confidence intervals and methodology documentation

## Timeline Estimate
- Data Source Evaluation: 0.5 week
- Data Structure Design: 1 week
- Validation Framework: 0.5 week
- Data Collection and Normalization: 1 week
Total: ~3 weeks
