# EPIC: UI/UX Design and Research

## Overview
This EPIC focuses on establishing the foundational UI/UX principles, design system, and interaction patterns for the GDP Timeline Visualization project. Through a series of spikes and research tasks, we will define the visual language, user flows, and animation strategies that will guide the entire implementation.

## Objectives
- Define a cohesive design system that supports the mellow, minimalist aesthetic
- Establish responsive design patterns for the scrollytelling experience
- Create interaction patterns for data visualization elements
- Design animation and transition specifications
- Define accessibility standards and requirements

## Dependencies
- None (This EPIC should be completed first as it informs other EPICs)

## Key Deliverables

### Design System
- Color palette definition (neutrals, accents, data visualization colors)
- Typography system (heading hierarchy, body text, data labels)
- Spacing and layout guidelines
- Component-level styling specifications
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior rules

### User Experience Flows
- Scrollytelling interaction patterns
- Chart interaction specifications (hover, click, transitions)
- Mobile/tablet adaptation strategy
- Loading states and progressive enhancement approach
- Error states and fallback behaviors

### Animation and Transition Specifications
- Scroll-based animation timings
- Data point highlight/focus transitions
- Text panel entry/exit animations
- Chart update/transition specifications
- Mobile-specific animation adjustments

### Accessibility Guidelines
- Color contrast requirements
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Screen reader compatibility guidelines
- Touch target sizes and spacing
- ARIA label specifications

## Research Spikes

### Spike 1: Scrollytelling Implementation
- Research and evaluate scrollytelling libraries (react-scrollama, intersection-observer)
- Prototype basic scroll-based interactions
- Document performance implications
- Define fallback patterns for older browsers

### Spike 2: D3.js Integration Patterns
- Evaluate D3.js integration approaches with React/Next.js
- Test animation performance with large datasets
- Document best practices for responsive SVG layouts
- Prototype tooltip and interaction patterns

### Spike 3: Mobile-First Adaptation
- Research mobile scrollytelling patterns
- Prototype chart adaptations for small screens
- Document touch interaction patterns
- Test performance on various devices

## Success Criteria
- Completed design system documentation
- Prototyped and tested scrollytelling interactions
- Defined and documented animation specifications
- Established accessibility guidelines
- Performance benchmarks for animations and interactions
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns

## Technical Considerations
- Browser compatibility requirements
- Performance budgets for animations
- Mobile device support specifications
- Accessibility compliance standards (WCAG 2.1)

## Risks and Mitigations
- Complex animations might impact performance
  - Mitigation: Establish performance budgets and testing criteria
- Mobile scrollytelling challenges
  - Mitigation: Mobile-first design approach and thorough testing
- Browser compatibility issues
  - Mitigation: Define progressive enhancement strategy

## Timeline Estimate
- Design System Definition: 1 week
- UX Flow Documentation: 1 week
- Animation Specification: 1 week
- Accessibility Guidelines: 0.5 week
- Research Spikes: 1.5 weeks
Total: ~5 weeks
