## Critical Dependencies

1. **Design System Dependencies**
   - Color palette and typography must be defined before any UI implementation
   - Spacing and layout guidelines needed for component architecture

2. **Data Structure Dependencies**
   - GDP data extraction must be completed before timeline implementation
   - Content structure needed before implementing scrollytelling sections

3. **Technical Dependencies**
   - Project setup must be completed before any implementation
   - Data access layer must be ready before visualization implementation
   - Core visualization needed before implementing interactions

## Parallel Work Opportunities

1. **Documentation & Implementation**
   - Documentation can be written alongside implementation
   - Test writing can happen in parallel with feature development

2. **Data & UI Work**
   - Data structure work can progress while UI/UX design is finalized
   - Component setup can happen while data models are being created

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Early Risk Mitigation**
   - Complete research spikes in Week 1
   - Validate technical approaches early
   - Set up core infrastructure before complex features

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Regular integration of features
   - Continuous testing throughout development
   - Early performance monitoring

## Success Metrics for Each Phase

### Phase 1 Success
- Complete design system documented
- Data structures defined and validated
- Project infrastructure ready for development

### Phase 2 Success
- Core visualization working with real data
- Scrollytelling basic functionality working
- Interactive features implemented

### Phase 3 Success
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Passing accessibility tests
- Meeting performance benchmarks
- Complete documentation

## Notes
- Timeline is based on single developer working full-time
- Each day should include code review and testing
- Regular check-ins on performance metrics
- Documentation should be updated continuously
