# AI-Assisted Interactive GDP Timeline Visualization

## Project Overview

You will build an **interactive timeline** that shows how major technological revolutions—starting around 1700 and projecting into the mid-21st century—have driven global GDP growth. The application will:

1. **Visualize key data points** (e.g., 1700, 1820, 1900, 1950, 2000, 2020, 2050) illustrating GDP estimates and significant tech breakthroughs (steam engine, industrial revolutions, computing, AI, etc.).  
2. **Allow users to hover or click** on data points to reveal more details—numeric GDP figures, short descriptive text about breakthroughs, and possible links to further reading.  
3. **Feature AI-driven or text-based expansions** (e.g., collapsible sections, tooltips, or side-panels) for in-depth information on each epoch.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Line Chart**  
   - Built with **D3.js** inside a **React** (or Next.js) component.  
   - Tailwind CSS for styling (e.g., custom tooltips, minimalistic color schemes).

2. **Hover & Click Interactions**  
   - Hovering over a point on the line reveals a tooltip with:
     - Year  
     - Approximate GDP (in trillions)  
     - 1–2 lines of text describing the major tech revolution.
   - Clicking could open a side-panel or modal with expanded info.

3. **Scrolling or Paging**  
   - Optional “scroll-based” storytelling approach: as the user scrolls, the chart pans or highlights each major point in chronological order.
   - Alternatively, use “Next/Previous” buttons that animate transitions in the chart.

4. **AI/Text Integration**  
   - Integrate a simple chatbot or text expansion (though not strictly required) to provide deeper historical or future projections (e.g., GPT-based or local ML model calls).

5. **Data Filtering & View Modes**  
   - A toggle or dropdown to switch between “All Tech Revolutions” or a “Focus on AI” view, potentially altering which data points or text are emphasized.

6. **Future Projection Visualization**  
   - Use a **dotted or dashed line** (or alternate color) for 2020–2050 to indicate “projected” data.

## Data Summary

Below is a **condensed dataset** spanning from 1700 to projected 2050. Figures are “best estimates” from **Maddison**, **World Bank**, **IMF**, and other sources, often in **1990 International Geary-Khamis dollars** for pre-1950 data (converted estimates for 1950 onward). References are in the **Resources** section.

> **Note**: Historical data can vary by source. Some references show slightly different estimates (e.g., 1820 might be lower than 1700 due to estimation methods). You can refine the final dataset per your needs.

## Project Definition for a Code Generation AI Assistant

**User Story**  
“As a user, I want to visualize major technological revolutions from 1700 to 2050 alongside global GDP estimates, so I can understand how innovations have historically driven economic growth—and where AI might take us next.”

### Core Requirements

1. **Responsive Chart**  
   - D3-based line chart with hover tooltips and onClick expansions.  
   - Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Data Points**  
   - Each milestone (year) includes a label, approximate GDP, and a short descriptor of the tech breakthrough.

3. **Interaction**  
   - Tooltip on hover showing `Year`, `GDP`, `Key Tech Milestone`.  
   - Click or scroll triggers more in-depth text (could be a side panel, modal, or inline expansion).

4. **Projection**  
   - A dashed line or alternate color from 2020 to 2050.  
   - Possibly a separate dataset for future values.

5. **Styling**  
   - Tailwind classes for typography, spacing, coloring.  
   - Clean, professional “analytics” theme.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy to **Vercel** or **Netlify**.  
   - Must be fully responsive on desktop and mobile screens.

### Additional (Optional) Features

1. **Historical vs. Modern Toggle**  
   - Filter the chart to show data from 1700–1950 or 1950–2020.

2. **Scroll-based Storytelling**  
   - Each screen scroll or arrow press highlights the next milestone in the line chart.

3. **AI Content**  
   - A “Learn More” button that calls an AI API to generate additional context or future speculation.

## Implementation Outline

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app gdp-innovation-timeline --use-npm
   cd gdp-innovation-timeline
   npm install d3 tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   Configure Tailwind in tailwind.config.js and import in styles/globals.css.

2. Create Data Module
    A data/gdpData.js (or .ts) file exporting an array of objects, e.g.
    ```ts
    export const gdpData = [
    { year: 1700, gdp: 0.64, milestone: 'Pre-Industrial (coal use, primitive steam engines)' },
    { year: 1820, gdp: 0.69, milestone: 'First Industrial Revolution (steam engine improvements)' },
    // ...
    ];
    ```

3. **Build D3 Component**

    Create a React component (components/GdpChart.js) that:
    - Uses D3 scales (scaleLinear) for x (years) and y (GDP).
    - Draws an SVG line + circles for each data point.
    - Implements tooltips (a custom <div> or SVG <text> element).

4. **Interactivity**

    - On hover: show a brief tooltip.
    - On click: expand a sidebar or modal with the details text.

5. **Styling with Tailwind**

    - Create container classes for layout (e.g., className="w-full h-96 relative bg-white").
    - Style tooltips or side-panels with Tailwind utility classes ("absolute bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 rounded").

6. **Future Projection**

    - Separate the data into two arrays, historical (1700–2020) and projected (2021–2050), then draw two <path> elements with different stroke styles.
    - Or, add logic within a single dataset to switch to a dashed line after 2020.
