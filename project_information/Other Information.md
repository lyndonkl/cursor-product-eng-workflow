# Extended Data & Context for the GDP Timeline Visualization

This README builds on the original **AI-Assisted Interactive GDP Timeline Visualization** project by adding **country-specific insights** and **in-depth historical context**. Use these details in tooltips, side panels, or scrolling narrative sections to show how each major technological phase affected global GDP growth and regional development.
